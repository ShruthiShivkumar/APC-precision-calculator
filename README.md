This project implements an **arbitrary-precision arithmetic calculator** in C, capable of performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power on extremely large integers and decimal numbers using a linked-list-based Abstract Data Type (ADT). By slicing large numbers into manageable parts stored across linked list nodes, the calculator ensures precise and efficient computation beyond standard hardware limits. Special care is taken to handle edge cases, such as zero inputs and carry-forward operations, while optimizing for performance and portability across platforms using `sizeof(int)`. Applications include public-key cryptography and the computation of mathematical constants, making this project a versatile and practical solution for high-precision arithmetic tasks.
